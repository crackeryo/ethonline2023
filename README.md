## DualDialogue — Hearing voices from both sides. 

In an increasingly divided world, I am hoping to build a platform to encourage dialogue between two sides in potentially controversial topics. Many platform 
nowadays only recommend content similar to user’s point of view , but web3 is an open space and I hope to build something that encourage clash in opinion discussion 
in opinions with monetary incentive to ensure quality of opinion.

In this prototype user can create questions with two options with a bounty, deadline, and a small minimum entry stake. The minimum entry stake is meant to 
incentives good quality answers, which will be returned unless their answer as been marked as spam/hate speech.
